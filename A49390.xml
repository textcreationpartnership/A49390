            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HAving this Opportunity, I thought it convenient to let you underſtand how the Affairs are with us here: We have been accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome days off this Harbour, and have uſed all means to induce the <hi>French</hi> to come out and fight us, but all will not do; although yeſterday our Admiral command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fifteen Men of War, with four Fire-ſhips, to go into the very Road of <hi>Breſt,</hi> and put up the Flag of Defiance, yet notwithſtanding they would not offer to ſtir. Our Fleet is in a very good condition, and well mann'd, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Enemy to come out; for we are able to fight any Navy in the World. Our Fleet conſiſts of above Eighty Sail, Twelve of which carrys Flags <hi>(viz.)</hi> five <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſeven <hi>Dutch,</hi> and three more are daily expected. Some days ſince we took a ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel going from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> they pretended at firſt to be Proteſtants making their Eſcape, but upon ſtrict Enquiry they were found to be otherwiſe; and upon ſearch we found a Packet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under the Coat of the Maſt, which diſcovered the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue. They are <hi>Engliſh, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who had been for ſome time in the <hi>French</hi> King's Service, and were going to the late King in order to be preferred.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 6 -->
               <p>Yeſterday we took a ſmall <hi>French</hi> Man of War coming from <hi>Waterford;</hi> it ſhould have carried Thirty ſix Guns, but they had but Eighteen, they having left the reſt in <hi>Ireland:</hi> They had a Pacquet of Letters from the late King <hi>James</hi> going to the <hi>French King:</hi> The Captain of the ſaid Ship reports, that the late King declares, That all the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> have left King <hi>William,</hi> and that <hi>Scotland</hi> hath unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared for him: He gives out at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> Fleet is arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he will go with Ten thouſand men into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo to <hi>England.</hi> But I do not doubt, but by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, that we ſhall be able to prevent ever their coming thither. Again, he ſays. That the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parliament have paſſed an Act, for giving the late King <hi>James</hi> 20000 <abbr>
